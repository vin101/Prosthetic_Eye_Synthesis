# ProstheticEye
This project aims to digitalise the process of making a mold for making a Prosthetic Eye by using a 3D scan of the affected person's face and using the half with the eye intact to recreate the the other part's eye mold using symmetry. 

We are mostly using PCL (Point Cloud Library) and boost libraries for the project.
